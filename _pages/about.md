# Scott Novis
Welcome to my fiction site.  I write most of my content early drafts using Obsidian in markdown. I wanted a very simple way to share those pages with family and friends.

This website achieves that feet.  For my of my "formal" work, see [https://scottnovis.com](https://scottnovis.com).  That website has some added features that it will email you when I post something new.

You can also reach me at hello (at) scottnovis.com - replace the at sign with an `@`.
