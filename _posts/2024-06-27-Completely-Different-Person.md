excerpt: This is a story telling exercise from the book Long Story Short. I made a thesis about myself then told a story to prove it.

## My Thesis: 
### I become a different human being when I travel.

If you were to walk into my home office in sunny tempe Arizona, you would likely think two things.

1. why does this guy work in a cave?
2. Is he a horder?

The key words here are "shade" and "piles."  Piles of books, keyboards (apparently I have a keyboard fetish) notebooks, pens, and toys cover every horizontal surface.  My drawers and closet aren't much different.  I have no idea idea how many Harley T-shirts I own, but one year when I tossed out a few my wife had a sour look on her face.  I said, "what?"  
She pointed out that I had just "tossed" over $500 in shirts. I think that's when I started to realize I had a problem.

When I travel however, its like I'm a different person. I suddenly become _crazy_ efficient.  I once took a five day business trip with just a 20 liter backpack.  In case your wondering 20 liters is not nearly as big as you think - there are six year olds with backpacks bigger than that.  They need them ever since they got rid of school lockers.  I see them every fall walking to class looking like little old men and women hunched under the crushing weight of all those books.

But when I travel, whether it is on a plane, or on my Harley, I become like a Tetris expert, packing shapes and sizes into impossibly small layers until they seem to vanish.  I carefully select my clothes to minimize how much I have to carry. I travel with tiny optimal electronics - my phone does most of the heavy lifting, but my MacBook is a beast.  A power bank a few cables, and I'm ready to go.

I don't know why I'm like that.  I remember one time I was on an overnight retreat with some friends.  They all had these rollons and backpacks.  A couple guys had checked luggage.  I had a backpack.  That was it.  They were all like, "Where's your stuff?"  I responded, "How much stuff do you need for two days one night?  Besides, I'm wearing half of it now!"

My wife would have been so proud.  She just wishes I was like that at home.

Honestly, I think at home the issue is space. I think I have lots of it.  Hell there's a whole house.  I have the freedom to obsess over quality, or performance, and I'll go through a ton of different types of the same product looking for the perfect solution.  I wish I was making this up.  I may need to seek counseling but one fall I spent over $1,000 on markers.  That's right. Markers.  I was developing a cartoon style for writing blog posts - this was before the days of AI and generative images.  The worst part was that the best markers turned out to be $2 crayolas.  That's right, those big fat crayon like markers we all used in kindergarten.  10 colors. 20 cents a marker. That's all I needed.  

I donated most of the rest.  Well, my wife donated most of them. I managed to smuggle a few boxes out of the goodwill box and stash them in my office. She can't see them in the dark behind the stacks of notebooks and keyboards.
