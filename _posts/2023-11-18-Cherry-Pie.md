excerpt: Chapter 25 - Casandra gets her Cherry Pie
---  

Anil slammed his phone down in frustration. 
"Careful," Rodney warned him.  "Or you're going to have to by a new phone as well as that pie."  He nodded toward Casandra who was holding a pink box with a white bow in her lap.  Tony sitting next to her, was enjoying a pie of his own. Given that his came from local produce, his cost considerably less.  Her pie had not really cost half of Anil's ship, but the price was breathtaking all the same.  

"What's the problem?" He said to Anil around a mouth full of gooey sugarness.  "You wansome?"

Anil shook his head and turned to look out the window.  "The registry is all wrong," he said.  "Even if I get to her, I'm not sure they would turn her over to me."

"Still trying to figure out how to get back to your ship?" Rodney asked.

Anil nodded.

"You tired of us already?"

"The thought of unburdoning you is appealing," Anil sighed.  "This whole trip, the mission from your ai sponsor, it all just feels like such a waste of time."

"Then why don't you tell me what's going on?" Rodney asked.  "Were did Stikine and his family go?"

Anil kept looking out the window. "In truth, I don't know."

"Bullshit," Rodney said.

"No it's true. The only lead I had, where I was headed when I was intercepted by the Orbital Licensing Agency was one of the last stations Tim Connacher visited before he came to Earth."

"You were retracing his steps?"

Anil nodded. "I figured if I could track down where he was, I could piece together where he went."

"You didn't say where you were headed," Rodney brought the conversation back on task. "Where were you trying to jump?"

"The mining colony on Burnett-Davis"

"That is an extremely rough place to jump."

Anil shrugged. "Tim made it there and back. I reasoned I could do the same."

"What did he find Rashad?" Rodney asked. "What was he auctioning off?"

"Power," was Anil's response.  Rodney waited for him to say more, then he seemed to make up his mind about something.  "I don't trust the Nexus, however, I am beginning to think it is in our best interest to untangle this mess."

The light outside the train changed dramatically as they descended from the light line in low orbit toward the station in Metripol South.  They were officially leaving the human section and entering the global city of Metripol South. Despite the fact that it was a global city, Metripol South felt small.  The poles were one of the few places on the planet where the GFU actively applied environmental engineering to create a bubble of civilization.  As the train descended to the surfacer, mountains of ice rose up on either side, like blue white scultpures however Rodney could see signs of a green space ahead.  The city was built in the ravines of the southern most mountains, which normally would have been buried under ice, but which the planetary government had cleared away to make it more habitable for the citizens.  

Rodney glanced at the map on his phone to refresh his memory.  The Metripols were laid out like flowers, with the "trade zone" in the center, and each planet having a small pie slice shaped petal on the periphery.  Technically called the boroughs, these zones tended to match their planetary section, but only superficially.  All of it was considered Metripol. The embassies of all the races were located in the trade zone, but their supporting staff, tended to live in the outskirts, almost always in the borough adjacent to their planetary section.  However, the boroughs could and did house anyone.  The train arrived at the outer ring, the end of section transport - like the spokes on a tire approaching the hub, the lines ended disgorging people into the melting pot of the city center.  

Rodney, Tony, Anil, and Casandra exited the sky train and walked onto what appeared to be a historical recreation of an old English train station.  Red brick facades and high arches surrounded the platform with green painted steel beams showing their rivets.  

"This is crazy," Tony said as they walked.

"I think you'll find the other train stations are similarly romantic," Anil said. "Metripol is not just a market, it is also a chance to show off, to express culture and heritage.  Each race wants the others to know what they are about."

Casandra added, "Yoos will see more traditional clothes here than in the sections.". She was holding her cherry pie like it was her prized possession.  At least she seemed to understand how valuable it was, but Rodney realized it was probably for a different meaning.

"Where to?" Rodney asked her.  

She seemed to think about it.  "I will lead you to the embassy, but you may not enter until you are summoned."

"So we're just letting you go inside without us and take that cake?" Tony said incredulously.

"It is a pie not a cake," Casandra corrected him.  "Yoos may not enter the embassy until summoned."

Rodney met Anil's eyes.  The situation wasn't great, but they didn't have a lot of other choices. Besides, the money was spent.  They weren't going to get it back.  "Fine," he said, "But we stay with you until you go in." He wanted to make sure she went. He had met her pushing a scam.  Maybe she wasn't who she said she was.

The group of four moved through the station to where they found a kiosk. Rodney connected his phone and purchased tickets for them for the road train.  A steady stream of electric vehicles, all of identical size, shape, and color, pulled into the building to pick up passengers and shuttle them toward the center of the Metroplex.  Rodney noticed that there were a lot of people lugging equipment.  "What's with the gear?" He pointed out to Anil.

Anil shrugged.  

"It's the trilunar music festival," Casandra explained.  "Don't yoos know anything?"

Rodney felt a shift in the pit of his stomach.  Odenshi had sent them here to get a song, in the middle of a music festival.  "Awesome," Rodney said with as much sarcasm as he could muster.

"Hold on," Anil paused.  "This might not be a bad thing."

"How do you figure?" Rodney asked.

"Lots of concerts means lots of people in the audience."

Rodney nodded. "More access."

Anil shrugged. "I think it's a possibility."

"Hey this sounds pretty cool," Tony spoke up.  "It's completely free, and virtually every major bar, pub, or joint in town is hosting a huge slew of bands.  There's got to be at least 200.  And check it out, the embassies are also hosting local and indigenous acts."

Rodney and Anil looked at each other.  "Let's get our princess to the embassy," Rodney said.  They stepped into their travel pod, and it whisked them out into traffic.  The flow of cars formed a train, each car magnetically connecting to the pod in front of it, and accelerated through the ice and rock cut into the glaciers at the edge of the Southern Pole of the planet.  Strings of multi-colored lights were hung from balconies in the ice.  Glacial motels, apartments, and hostels dotted the outer ring of Metripol South.  Banners flapped in the breeze touting the event, and welcoming music fans in every language.

The road train snaked through the canyons and moved them closer to the heart of the city.  Ice started to give way to hints of green, like a perpetual spring, until they were climbing up and down the rocky crags that made up the city.  Metropol South reminded Rodney of some of the mining towns he's seen in Colorado on Earth.  They couldn't be bothered to flatting the mountains or fill the valleys so they built with them.  There seemed to be some pockets of level terrain, those formed the court yards, and open spaces, but homes and apartments dotted the hills above these flat spaces.  The road train followed the flat concrete that snaked between the habitations and switch back up and down the mountains, make it almost feel like  carnival ride.

The ride from the outskirts to the heart of the metropolis took just under thirty minutes, and the closer they got to the center, the more people they saw.  To Rodney, it felt like the planet was emptying out into it's Southern pole to get ready for a weekend of live music and partying.  It was a strange feeling.  Humanity had been living under such intense pressure for so many generations now, that the idea of just cutting loose and having fun seemed.  Well wrong.  Sure it was a time of _peace_, as there were no open conflicts between the member states of the GFU, however that did not mean times were _peaceful_.

As they stepped out of the car, and into the city streats, Rodney sensed an energy here.  Something he could not remember feeling before.

"It's called fun," Anil whispered to him. "I suspect you've been in the reclaiming business too long.  People can have it you know."

Rodney grunted.  He'd have fun when this job was over.

"There's a lot more humans here than I expected," Tony said.  "And couples."

He was right.  As Rodney glanced around, he saw a substantial number of bipeds with Earth fleshtones. What's more, they seemed to be paired off, or in groups of females _and_ males.  He was also surprised to see _children_.  "Do they often take the younglings to the global market?" Rodney asked. 

"These aren't younglings," Anil answered.  "These are the defectors.  Not everyone agrees with the colonization policy.  The colony would pull them back if they could, but here, they are subject to Federal Union Law, not human law."

"You mean, those are..."

"Families," Anil said.  "Some traditions die hard.  The Governor and her triumvirate may believe men are not necessary for the raising of children, or that all women are happy to donate their offspring to the survival of the species _however_, not everyone agrees."

"They defected," Rodney said pondering the significance of that.  "What must the other species think of that?"

"We admire and hate them for it," Casandra spoke up for the first time.

"You didn't need to travel into the Human section to meet humans," Rodney turned to her.

"Yes and no," Casandra admitted. "I have met many humans.  But I could not experience what they were running from unless I traveled there."

"Did you get to experience it?" Rodney asked.

"Not yet.  This was just my first time, unescorted," Casandra replied.  "But I will go back. I will learn more."

"Why do the Govvu admire and hate the humans?" Tony asked.

"Some admire them.  Their freedom.  Others hate their lack of discipline and commitment.  Did you know that a human mand and female Govvu may sire a child together?"  She said this looking directly at Tony.

"Really? That works?"

Casandra nodded.  "You look like you would be a good specimen to breed with - " If Tony wasn't blushing, he was doing something close to it.  "- but my station prevents me from finding out."

"You're station?" Tony asked.

"I am a daughter of the King of our clan.  I am not some orphaned scop who can do with her body what she pleases.  My fertility belongs to our house.  I am obligated to copulate with a Govvu of my station."

"Gee, it sounds so romantic when you say it that way," Rodney chimed in.

"Oh yes, this value you humans place on emotional decision making, that is another attribute that causes us... consternation."

"Don't pretend like you don't feel things," Rodney said. "You said it yourself, Govvu and human's are genetically compatible.  You feel."

"Yes I do!" Casandra agreed. "But we have ritual, tradition, and family bond to protect us from our emotions."

They paused at the entrance to a massive courtyard, it was one of the few places where the planetary engineers had leveled the hills and smoothed the valleys.  

"Embassy Park," Anil announced as they took in the view.  It reminded Rodney of Central Park in New York City, only instead of sky scrapers all around, it was hills and canyons lined with buildings and structures, many of which bridged the narrow valleys that twisted between the vertical stone walls.  

Around the periphery of the green space stood enormous compounds, the embassies.  It was clear that this place was as much about showing off to the neighbors as it was about functionality.  Each embassy faced the central area with it's lush vegetation, rivers, small ponds, and walking paths. The electric vehicles circulated around the periphery.  Only organic power was allowed in the green belt.  That meant walking on foot, or taking a carriage pulled by some beast of burden.  Rodney saw a few horses, but just as many other creatures.  Some looked like Zebras, but others were strange, like big balls of rolling spikes, or lizards with fat bellies that scraped along the ground.  He saw a couple carriages pulled by tall blue creatures that looked like giraffes with scales.  

"There," Casandra pointed to one particularly impressive monument on the far side of the park.  "The Govvu Embassy."  It was an impressive structure, built from some kind of white stone, it looked like it had gems the size of basketballs mounted at the top of every column.  The building made Rodney think of something that was a blend between ancient Greek architecture, a fairy tale castle, and something designed for mer-people.  Shells, and aquatic themes decorated the building.  The Govvu didn't just like water, they _revered_ the sea.  

Casandra led them up to the front gate, holding her pie box out in front of her like some kind of ceremonial offering.  As they approached the compound entrance, Rodney noted two guards, well armed stationed to either side of the gate.  They were likely there, not so much for show, but to remind everyone that the entire compound was guarded, and probably by weapon systems you couldn't see.  Rodney was quickly scanning the fence, and perimeter when Casandra seemed to trip, and the pie box _flew_ out of her hands.  Both Rodney and Anil lunged to grab it.  That was when she made her move.  In the blink of an eye, she ducked and sprinted to the left into the crowd and along the fenced side of the embassy.

Anil caught the box, but then held it up. It was empty.

Rodney spun to go after her, realizing she had duped them, he just thought she would try to go once they were inside.  Rodney pulled a small black ball out of his pocket and tossed it into the air. The microdrone took off, homing in on the beacon Rodney had planted in the pie when he bought it.  A kind of alarm went off, chiming in several languages before it said in common, "No drones or filming in the Embassy."  The drone wasn't in embassy air space, but there was still a chance they could shoot it down.  Rodney reluctantly issued the device an order to stay clear of the Govvu compound.  

He pushed his way through the crowd, half heartedly giving chase.  She would make some move or another to lose them, but the drone would be nearly impossible to shake.  He watched as she deftly flowed through the crowd.  "Princess my ass," Anil said watching Rodney's screen.  

Then, she surprised them both.  She did manage to ditch the droid.  She turned and went through a side gate and into the compound.  Rodney raised up the drone to get video of her as she went into the house.  He caught a glimpse of two boys along side her when the bright flash of a pulse rifle ended their video footage when it vaporized the drone.

Now Casandra and the cherry pie were out of reach.
