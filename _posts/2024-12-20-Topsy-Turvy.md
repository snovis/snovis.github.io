The day Jeremy ruined my life, all I wanted was to enjoy one last glorious day hanging out with our friends.  

We'd taken the transfer gate to South Florida where his father kept his speed boat.  Originally it was just supposed to be the four of us, Jeremy, Ian, Tristan and me.  The four Amigos. But of course Jeremy's kid sister Emily tagged along.  She always tagged along. I didn't mind, but she really wasn't a little kid any more.  It was hard to pretend she didn't fill out our swimming suit in an appealing way.  She was moving from cute to sexy in an uncomfortably awkward way.  The casual familiarity we had enjoyed now came with a kind of heat. I pushed it down. She was my best friends sister, and still in middle school!  We would graduate in the spring.  It wasn't right, but I couldn't help but steal glances when she wasn't looking.

"Thanks for setting this up!" Tristan said to Jeremy as he hopped onto the boat.  "Yeah," Ian slapped him on the back.  "Same," I chimed in.  Together, we made up the starting core of the state champion Angel Fire High baseball team.  They say you put the talent up the middle and that was us.  Ian in center, Tristan at short, Jeremy on the mound, with me behind the plate.  Jeremy wasted no time.  He hit the switches and the automated docks released the boat as the twin motors started to thrum.  We pulled away from the marina, Jeremy pushing the throttle, flaunting the no wake zone like the rich kid he was. "Beers are in the cooler!" He shouted over his shoulder.

I climbed up to the captains deck to join him, bringing a couple of cold ones with me.  We needed a day like this.  Perfect sun, flat open ocean, with hardly anyone around.  Who knew when we would get together again like this?  We caught a lull between all the workouts, semester finals, and college applications.  Ian was heading to the West Coast, Tristan was being recruited to play ball back east - man he could glide, gobbling up ground balls like a human vacuum cleaner.  Jeremy and I however had other plans.  We had both applied to the Outrider Academy, the elite of the elite in the Frontier Guard.  

Jeremy applied because I did.  I applied because my grandfather served in the Front Guard, and ever since I was a little kid he had regaled me of stories of their heroism and bravery.  If there was one thing that would make my Pappy proud, it was if I made it into the Outriders.  My own father was not as convinced, but like all things, as long as I got good grades and kept my nose clean, he trusted me to do what was best.  That was his motto practically, "Do what is best.  Stay out of trouble."

It never occurred to me that those two things could contradict each other.  I grew up believing doing what was best would _keep_ you out of trouble.  

Jeremy blared the tunes and slalomed the enormous boat out into the shallow ocean off the shore of South Beach.  Ian and Tristan scouted the cabin for snacks, while Emily snuck a beer of her own.  I felt her looking at me and I felt myself blush.  Damn it.  I turned so she couldn't see the effect she was having on me.  Her doe like brown eyes, and full lips made her look a _lot_ older than fourteen.  Jeremy seemed to be rocking out to his own tune, lost in his head.  He stared off into the waves.

"What do you think it will be like?" He asked.  "The academy?"

I shrugged.  We'd both visited the campus in Colorado Springs.  The ancient US Space Force campus has expanded to engulf the entire metropolitan area, but the Outrider Academy dominated the center of the massive complex.  "It's going to be awesome."

"It's going to be dangerous," Jeremy said taking another sip of beer.

"We'll be trained for it," I shot back.  I was completely confident we would stand out, like we always had.  Just like we had in football, just like we had in baseball.  We would work hard and excel. That's what we do.  "There's nothing they can't put in front of us we can't handle," I said and I believed it too.  In that moment of sun, and wind I felt incredibly alive.  I took a sip of beer and snuck a glance back at Emily, and caught Tristan moving in to sit next to her.  Apparently it didn't bother him at all that she was so young, or Jeremy's sister.  Ian stood behind them on the aft deck.

The sight of Tristan putting his arm around around Emily irritated me way more than it should have.  Instantly I was hot.  They didn't seem to notice that I was staring at them. Ian noticed. He shrugged.  Now I was mad at Ian.  Why didn't he do something the prick?  I turned to Jeremy and tapped him on the shoulder and nodded back toward the lower deck and the curved seating area where Tristan was now getting a little too friendly with Emily and to my complete annoyance she did not seem to mind the attention one bit.

Jeremy glanced, gave me a cock-eyed half grin then said, "I got this" and without a warning, he cranked the wheel hard to the right as he smashed the throttle forward with the beer in his hand... the boat roared forward like an angry dragon bucking hard and then all hell broke loose.

I heard Ian give a shout first, then Emily scream.  And it wasn't a good scream, like the roller coaster ride kind of scream. I felt my stomach drop.  She screamed like she was really scared.  Jeremy had cranked the wheel too far and the boat was pitching up and forward as if it was about to topple.  With no warning and nothing to hold onto, I saw Ian grab for the flagpole at the back of the boat and miss it. He went airborne right as Jeremy tried to steer back to the left and overcorrected.  The deck fell away from me as something struck me in the back.  It was the railing behind me, the boat started to roll like a whale breaching the water.  Jeremy dropped the beer but it was too late to grab the throttle and pull back.  The last thing I saw was him holding onto the steering wheel with one hand like a sail about to tear free from its mast.  Then the deck slammed into my face as the boat rolled over and submerged into the waves, taking me along with it.
