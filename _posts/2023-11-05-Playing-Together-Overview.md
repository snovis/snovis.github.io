# Overview
Welcome valued reveiwer!  This website is a "secret." It contains the text of my new book, and I'm asking for feedback.  This book is very much a work in progress, but the first draft is finished, and I am now posting the revised chapters as I work my way through them.

The Table of Contents for this book is:

- The Introduction
- Chapter 1 - Wrong Aim
- Chapter 2 - Wrong Channel
- Chapter 3 - Wrong Approach
- Chapter 4 - Better Communication
- Chapter 5 - Better Cooperation
- Chapter 6 - Better Collaboration
- Chapter 7 - Round One - First Day On The Job
- Chapter 8 - Round Two - Planning Together
- Chapter 9 - Round Three - It Takes a Team
- Chapter 10 - The Tools

The aim of the book is to give you the principles, and the tools to be able to conduct a workshop to help your team work together better.
