# Welcome
This is meant to be a _very_ simple website designed to help me push drafts of my fiction onto the web so I can share with family and friends.  Eventually, I may start putting it on my main blog ghost.io - but I don't want people to get emailed every time I post a bit of fiction, especially if there are drafts.

I'm sure I could share word docs and such, but since I write in Markdown, I thought it would be nice to be able to post in markdown quickly and efficiently.  and since Working Copy in the iPhone links with Textastic - I can in theory easily publish from my phone.
