## A Novel Idea
This is a quest story I am trying to write. A quest plot has a certain archetype plot with certain beats and certain character roles. At this point I am not worried about being original.  I simply want to write something interesting and explore discovery writing a character I like and find interesting. 

The "Quest" story archetype typically involves the following major plot points:


1. **The Call to Adventure**: The story begins with the protagonist receiving a call to embark on a quest. This call can come from a variety of sources, such as a mentor, a prophecy, or a personal desire to achieve something significant.

2. **The Departure**: The protagonist leaves their ordinary world behind and sets out on the journey. They may leave home, gather supplies, or assemble a team of companions to accompany them.

3. **Trials and Challenges**: Along the journey, the protagonist faces a series of trials, challenges, and obstacles. These tests often serve to develop their character, skills, and determination.

4. **Allies and Enemies**: The protagonist encounters both allies who aid them on their quest and enemies or antagonistic forces that oppose them. These interactions add depth to the story and contribute to the challenges the hero faces.

5. **The Approach to the Inmost Cave**: In many quest stories, there is a pivotal moment where the protagonist approaches the heart of the quest, often a dangerous or mysterious place. This can be a physical location or a symbolic goal.

6. **The Ordeal**: The protagonist faces their greatest challenge or crisis. This is a climactic moment in the story where the hero's resolve and abilities are tested to the limit.

7. **The Reward**: After overcoming the ordeal, the protagonist is rewarded with some valuable prize or knowledge. This reward may be the primary goal of the quest or a significant step toward it.

8. **The Return**: The hero begins the journey back to their ordinary world, often with newfound wisdom, experience, or a physical treasure. The return journey can present its own challenges and encounters.

9. **The Resurrection**: There is often a final, intense confrontation or test before the quest's completion. This serves as a final test of the protagonist's growth and transformation.

10. **The Return with the Elixir**: The hero returns to the ordinary world, bringing back the knowledge, treasure, or lessons learned during the quest. This can have a positive impact on the hero's world or society.

The "Quest" archetype is a common structure in many classic tales, including "The Lord of the Rings," "The Odyssey," and "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," where the protagonist embarks on a transformative journey to achieve a significant goal or fulfill a destiny.



## Characters
In the quest story archetype, you'll generally find a variety of character types that contribute to the unfolding adventure. Here are some common characters:

1. **The Hero**: The central character who undertakes the quest, often displaying traits such as courage, perseverance, and moral integrity.
2. **The Mentor**: A wise figure who provides guidance, knowledge, and training to the hero.
3. **The Sidekick**: A loyal companion to the hero, often providing support, friendship, and sometimes comic relief.
4. **The Love Interest**: A character who represents a romantic interest or connection for the hero, often serving as a motivation or a reward at the quest's completion.
5. **The Villain**: The primary antagonist who opposes the hero, often embodying negative or evil qualities.
6. **The Gatekeeper**: Characters who pose challenges or obstacles that the hero must overcome, sometimes offering tests or riddles.
7. **The Oracle/Seer**: A figure who possesses special knowledge or prophetic abilities, providing the hero with insights or forewarnings about the quest.
8. **The Trickster**: A character who creates complications or mischief, sometimes serving as an ally or a hindrance to the hero.
9. **Supporting Characters**: These characters assist or accompany the hero during different stages of the quest, providing various forms of assistance or hindrance.

Each of these character types plays a significant role in shaping the narrative and helping to drive the plot forward. They are classic elements in many quest narratives, from ancient mythologies to modern fantasy stories.
